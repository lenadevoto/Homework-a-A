#                                     Dancing Octopus
# Full of fish, the Octopus attempts Dance Dance Revolution. The game has tiles
# in the following directions:

# # tiles_array = ["up", "right-up", "right", "right-down", "down", "left-down", "left",  "left-up" ]

# # To play the game, the octopus must step on a tile with her corresponding tentacle.
# We can assume that the octopus's eight tentacles are numbered and correspond to the tile direction indices.

                                    # # Slow Dance
# # Given a tile direction, iterate through a tiles array to return the tentacle number (tile index)
#  the octopus must move. This should take O(n) time.

# # slow_dance("up", tiles_array)     > 0

# # slow_dance("right-down", tiles_array)   > 3


                                  # # Constant Dance!
# # Now that the octopus is warmed up, let's help her dance faster. Use a different data structure
# and write a new function so that you can access the tentacle number in O(1) time.

# fast_dance("up", new_tiles_data_structure)         > 0
#
# fast_dance("right-down", new_tiles_data_structure)     > 3



#                                 linear octopus dance
# tiles_array = ["up", "right-up", "right", "right-down", "down", "left-down", "left",  "left-up" ]
